		/*
		 * OOP - Also known as Object Oriented Programming
		 * 
		 * OOP a programming paradigm focused on describing real world entities as objects in a program
		 * 
		 * There are two key pieces to OOP -- Classes and Objects
		 * 
		 * Class - The blueprint for an object.
		 * 
		 * Object - An instance of a class. It deals with the particulars such as the data. Each have their own
		 *          values associated them.
		 *          
		 * OOP consists 4 major pillars:
		 * 
		 * 1. Inheritance
		 *    - Inheritance provides us a way to reuse logic from a parent class (focuses on parent-child relations)
		 *    - IS-A relationships. A Square is a Rectangle, but a Rectangle is not necessarily a Square
		 *      Since a Square is a Rectangle, we can treat as a Rectangle
		 *    - This is done with the extends keyword
		 *    - The child has the ability to overwrite any of the behavior specified in the parent class. This is known
		 *      as method overriding.
		 * 2. Encapsulation
		 *    - We use this to limit access to attributes of our objects. Data protection
		 *    - This is primarily done through access modifiers and a thing called getters and setters
		 *    - public/private/protected
		 * 3. Polymorphism
		 *    - Literally means "many forms"
		 *    - Allows us to define multiple functions with the same name, but so long as they have different parameters
		 *      they are treated as separate. This is known method overloading
		 * 4. Abstraction
		 *    - The process of masking the underlying details or functionality of a program or operation.
		 *    - Allows us to interface with it more easily (user-machine interaction)
		 *    - Think car pedals and how we don't have to know how a car works, just that it makes it go
		 *    - Facade Design Pattern

	 * driveEntity takes in a Driveable object and uses its driveVehicle method

	 * The fact that the parameter is Driveable and not something specific like Bicycle has pros and cons

	 * Pros: 
	 * - Allows our function to be more flexible in what it takes in (Bikes, Horses, Scooters)
	 * - Functional, since we're only using the driveVehicle method and we know that's what all Driveables can do
	 * 
	 * Cons:
	 * - We're limited in what we can do with this object
	 * - We can only do things a Driveable can do as opposed to everything else something like a 
	 *   bike can do (brake, access bike properties)

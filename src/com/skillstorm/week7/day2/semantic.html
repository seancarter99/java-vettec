        Semantic Tags

        Semantic tags are a great way to establish additional meaning to your webpage beyond
        just the look of it.

        Using semantic tags do NOT change the way your website looks/behaves, it only adds meaning

        Pros of semantic tags:
        - Code readability
        - Screen readers

        Examples of semantic tags:

        - article (Self contained conent: think a news article on NYT)
        - main (main content of the page) (there should only be one main tag per page)
        - nav (contains the navigation aspects)
        - section (specific section of the page)
        - header (Information towards the top of the page) (Article titles, author, date published, etc)
        - footer (Information towards the bottom/closing remarks)

        Non-semantic tags

        Non-semantic tags are tags that carry no meaning
        
        Everything you can do with a semantic tag, the same can be achieved with a non-semantic tag

        Div and Span:

        Div and Span tags are the most generic of tags
        Are commonly used as "containers"
        Containers are used for holding groupings of data together as well as applying styles in bulk


        Inline vs Block Style Elements:

        Inline tags operate within a block and only take up as much space as needed

        Examples of inline tags:
        - span
        - b/strong
        - i/em
        - a (hyperlink)
        - img

        Block tags start on a new line and stretch across as much space as they are given

        Examples of block tags:
        - div
        - p
        - article
        - section
        - form
        - li
    -->

    <!-- 
        h1 is an inline tag and is used to symbolize the title of a webpage
        Generally, you should only use one h1 per page

        headers range from h1 to h6

        <h1>H1</h1>
        <h2>H2</h2>
        <h3>H3</h3>
        <h4>H4</h4>
        <h5>H5</h5>
        <h6>H6</h6>
     -->
    <main>
        <h1>Places to See!</h1>
    </main>
    <article>
        <!-- I want to have a spot for the article title as well as the main content -->

                Dubai is a city and emirate in the United Arab Emirates known for luxury shopping, ultramodern
                architecture and a lively nightlife scene. Burj Khalifa, an 830m-tall tower, dominates the
                skyscraper-filled skyline. At its foot lies Dubai Fountain, with jets and lights choreographed to music.
                On artificial islands just offshore is Atlantis, The Palm, a resort with water and marine-animal parks.

                Located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf, Dubai aims to be
                the business hub of Western Asia. It is also a major global transport hub for passengers and cargo. Oil
                revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a major mercantile hub. A
                centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy relies on
                revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services. Oil production contributed
                less than 1 percent of the emirate's GDP in 2018. The city has a population of around 2.9 million (as of
                2017).

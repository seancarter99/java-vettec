What is React?

- React is a JavaScript UI Library (Framework)
- Developed by Facebook (now Meta)
- Utilizes a component based system for designing parts of a page in a reusable way
- Allows us to separate logic into reusable components that each handle their own internal state
- React takes HTML and brings it into the JS file
- Frameworks like Angular or Vue work the opposite and add JS to the HTML files

Why React?

Virtual DOM
- It is a measure React has put in place to optimize the alteration of the normal JS DOM there
- It works by maintains an old copy of the virtual DOM and a new copy whenever the state of 
  application is changed. Then, it only changes what actually changed
- React believes that what is displayed should be a reflection of the application's state
  - React is a function where View = function(state)
- React interfaces with the DOM to intelligently only rerender elements that have had their state changed

State
- State is the internal behavior or data of an application/component
  - Ex. current count for a counter, the data currently input into a form, 
    whether a display is open or closed, etc.
- To update the view we update the state
- The view itself CANNOT update the state
- One Way Data Binding (State can update view, but view cannot update state)
- If I want the view to update the state, I must explicitely write a way for it to do so

JSX
- JavaScript and XML
- Not actually XML, it just borrows the syntax
- We can use it to write "HTML" in the JS code
- Under the hood, JSX is simply JavaScript code
- Babel converts the JSX into React.createElement()

Components
- A mechanism for separating logic into reusable parts used to create a larger application
- A large application is comprised of many different components
- Each component is in charge of its own state
- When that component's state changes, React will rerender based off what changed

What is NPM?

- Node Package Manager
- Allows to us to share, use, and reuse code from and with other developers
- Package manager means that we maintain the versioning of our dependency Package

JSON
- Stands for "JavaScript Object Notation"
- It has over the course of the past decade, become the de facto way of transfering data
- It took over its predecessor XML
- It utilizes JS object syntax for housing and storing data
- The catch is that everything MUST be stored as a string and contained within double quotes ""

NPM Commands

npm -v
- Prints the current version of npm

npm init
- Create a file known as a package.json in the current directory
- It allows us to create a "node project" with its own dependencies

npm init -y
- Creates a default package.json
- The same as typing npm init and then hitting enter without typing for every answer

npm install <package-name>
- Installs as a dependency the package you wish to install

npm install
- Since we don't push node_modules to GitHub, when someone clones my repository, how do they get
  the source code from the packages?
- Installs all of the dependencies in the package-lock.json
- If there's no package-lock.json, it'll use package.json and figure it out from there

npm uninstall
- Uninstalls a dependency from a project
- Removes it and all of its dependencies from node_modules, package.json, and package-lock.json

npm update <package-name>
- Updates the specified package to the highest version allowed
- ^ Updates minor fixes (0.x.x)
- ~ Updates patch fixes (0.0.x)
- No Symbol Updates to the highest version on NPM

npx <package-name>
- One time use, it doesn't install the package, it just executes it

NPM Flags:

-g
- Installs the package globally
- Stored in a singular place on your computer, but it's the same version across projects

-D | --save-dev
- Installs the package as a devDependency
- These are packages that will not be shipped to the production version of the app
- ex. (Linters, TypeScript types, testing libraries)

--production
- Runs the application entry point (index.js) without using the devDependency
- Runs the application in "production" mode

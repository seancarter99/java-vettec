# What is Spring?

- Spring came to solve Java's lack of a distinct web framework
- Before, we had to find our own web server and write low level servlet code to handle HTTP requests
- This was often paired with JSPs to process the request and a send back an HTML page
- Spring has a vast ecosystem consisting of many, many different modules
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Data
  - Spring Security
  - Spring Cloud
- Spring believes in this concept known as "Inversion of Control" or "Dependency Injection"

# Dependency Injection
Dependency Injection is a design pattern that aims to solve problems of "tight coupling" problems with object creation
- DI believes that an object shouldn't be worried about creating an object it is dependent on, but rather given it outright
- We typically break our Java logic into two sections for this process
  1. Services
    - These are classes that provide useful logic to be consumed by client classes
    - It will "service" the client by processing some request
  2. Clients
    - Clients are typically dependent on a service
    - A prime example is our Controllers

# Spring vs Spring Boot
Spring Boot is built on top of Spring as an opinionated way of writing Spring applications
- Spring Boot favors convention over configuration
  - No need to write intense boiler plate code/huge XML configurations when Spring Boot can do that for you
  - Most configuration today with Spring Boot is automatically done through annotations
- Spring Boot is widely used in industry today (Spring Framework is considered legacy)
- Spring Boot auto configures your project based off the Spring services added to it
- Comes with an Apache TomCat server right out of the box

# Common Spring Annotations

- @SpringBootApplication
  - It is an abstraction over 3 other annotations 
    1. @Configuration
    2. @EnableAutoConfiguration
    3. @ComponentScan
  - It autoconfigures the project based off the dependencies found in the pom.xml
  - It also parses your project for any @Component and will register them in the application context as "beans"
- @Component
  - Marks a class as something to be created by Spring
- @Controller
  - A stereotype annotation that works functionally the same as @Component, but is more semantic
  - This annotation should be used for sending entire pages to users (HTML, JSP, ASP)
- @RequestMapping
  - Annotation that refers to a specific endpoint
    - Can be added to the class to add the route to ALL methods
    - Can be added to a method to specify the route for that method
  - Two parameters that it takes
    - value: The URL to listen to
    - method: The HTTP method to listen for
- @GetMapping
  - Does the same as @RequestMapping, but automatically listens for only GET requests
- @RequestBody
  - Used to retrieve a value from the HTTP request body
  - Uses Jackson under the hood to translate from JSON to our Java object
- @ResponseBody
  - Used to send back JSON in the HTTP response body
  - Whatever is returned will be sent as the response body
- @RestController
  - Another stereotype annotation that works mostly the same as @Controller
  - Think of this annotation as @Controller + (@ResponseBody on every single method)
  - We use it for REST endpoints (AKA all they do is send back JSON data)

Hibernate Annotations:
- @Entity
  - Indicates that the class is to be managed by Hibernate
- @Table
  - If the class name is a different name than the SQL table, you use this to specify its actual name
  - This is necessary if our SQL table name is something not friendly to Java
    - ex. book_info
- @Id
  - Used to indicate the primary key of the table
- @GeneratedValue
  - Indicates that the parameter is being generated by the database
  - Takes a parameter called strategy which is used to indicate the method of generation
    - For MySQL auto increment, use GenerationType.IDENTITY
- @Column
  - Used to indicate that this is a column in the table
  - Takes a parameter called name to indicate the actual SQL name of the column if the Java name is different
    - Some names aren't Java friendly such as first_name
  - By default, this can be nulled
- @Nullable
  - Indicates that this column is optional (can be nulled)

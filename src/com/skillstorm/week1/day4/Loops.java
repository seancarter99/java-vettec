		 * 
		 * Loops are just blocks of code that will continuously execute so long as their condition is met

		 * Similar to an if statement with the conditions

		 * Loop process
		 * 
		 * So long as the boolean condition is true, the following block of code will be executed. Once that block
		 * finishes execution, the boolean condition is rechecked. If it is true, runs the block again and so on
		 * If it is false, the code does not the block of code and continues with the program normally

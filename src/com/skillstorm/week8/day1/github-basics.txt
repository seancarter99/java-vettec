What is GitHub?

- GitHub is a popular software versioning system
- It acts as a central repository for all of your code and files
- Think of it as your project folder and all its files stored online in the cloud
- If anyone else in the world wants to use what you've written, they can pull your code and use it

File commands:

ls - List

ls - lists all the folders and files in the current directory
ls <file-name> - lists all the folders and files in the directory specified

cd - Change directory

cd <file-name> - Navigate into the specified file (if it exists)
cd .. - Navigate up into the parent directory/folder


Git Commands:

git add <file>
- This adds the modified file to be committed (stages for commitment)

git commit -m "<message>"
- This commits in bulk all of the added files under one commit message
- The commit message should be descriptive of what actually changed about the file

git push
- Pushes all of the commited code to GitHub repository

git pull
- Pulls all of the commits not found in the local environment into the local environment
- If the main repository has the commit, but the local doesn't, git pull will add it
- In general, git pull then git push

        Id vs Class

        I should be using id whenever I want to target a very specific element on the webpage.
        Id should be unique across the page (Only one element will have a given id)

        Scenario: I have two forms on my page; I have a registration form and also a login form. I might want
        these two styled differently so I could use ids to accomplish this

        --------------------------------------------------------------------

        I should be using classes whenever I want to style a grouping of elements in bulk. Class is primarily used
        to group elements in order to target them and style them all together.

        Scenario: We want our form rows to remain consistent across our page (regardless of which form it is)
        so I will use classes in order to style that accordingly.
